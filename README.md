# Replication Files for Role-Based Status Construction (online and lab)
 
This is the repository for the paper "Role Hierarchy as A Status Construction Machine: A Replication" accepted by Social Psychological Quarterly. 
Here, you will find the .qsf file, which you can upload to qualtrics and collect data exactly as we have. You can also access our data management and analysis files.
 

Please reach out to me at yujia-lyu@uiowa.edu with any questions, comments, or concerns.
